To contribute to the project, first visit the issues tab in github and take up an issue. Taking up an issue is as simple as commenting on it saying you are going to take it up. We will assign you the issue post that. Please avoid taking up issues that someone else has already taken up. Once assigned, you can make your changes and push the code. Please follow the below guidelines for the same:

- Clone the project, checkout to the branch and start working on the issue.
- Once done, add, commit and push your changes to your forked repo.
- After pushing, make a PR (pull request) to the main branch of the actual repository

We will verify your PR post that and merge it if everything looks good. It will be posted to dev.to post that, and will contain your name. Please mention your dev.to username in the PR if you wish to be tagged in the post.
