## What is Machine Learning?

Artificial intelligence, which is widely defined as a machine's ability to mimic intelligent human behaviour, includes the subfield of *machine learning*. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are used to carry out complicated tasks in a manner akin to how people solve issues.

In classic terms, machine learning is **a type of artificial intelligence that enables self-learning from data and then applies that learning without the need for human intervention**.

The 4 types of learning in Machine Learning are:

1. Supervised Learning.
2. Unsupervised Learning.
3. Semi-Supervised Learning.
4. Reinforcement Learning.

### Supervised Learning

In Supervised Learning we estimate the outcome based on well-labeled training data that has been used to train them. The term "labelled data" refers to input data that has already been assigned the appropriate output. The training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly.

Finding a *mapping function* to link the input variable (x) with the output variable is the goal of a supervised learning algorithm (y).

#### Steps involved in Supervised Learning:

* Identify the training dataset type.
* Collect the labelled training data.
* Create *training*, *test*, and *validation* datasets from the training dataset.
* Identify the training dataset's input features, which should have sufficient details to enable reliable output prediction.
* Choose the best method for the model, such as a decision tree, random forest a support vector machine.
* Apply the algorithm on the practise data. Validation sets, a subset of training datasets, are occasionally required as control parameters.
* Use the test set to determine the model's correctness. If the model correctly predicts the outcome, then it is accurate.

Types of *Supervised Learning* Algorithms:

1. **Regression:**

   * Regression Trees
   * Linear Regression
   * Polynomial Regression
   * Bayesian Linear Regression
   * Non-Linear Regression
2. **Classification**:

   * Decision Trees
   * Random Forest
   * Logistic Regression
   * Support vector Machine
