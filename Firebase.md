# Firebase

Firebase is a collection of hosting services to host any kind of application founded by **James Tamplin**
and **Andrew Lee** It provides *real-time* and *NoSQL* database hosting, content, social authentication, and notifications, in addition to other services including a real-time communication server.

Developers can create *iOS*, *Android*, and *Web apps* using the Google-sponsored application development platform. Tools are available from Firebase for monitoring analytics, reporting and resolving app errors, as well as developing marketing and product experiments.

It aims to solve 3 main problems for developers:
- Quicker app creation
- With confidence, release and monitor an app.
- Engage more users

## Popular Apps Using Firebase
- Alibaba
- The New York Times
- eBay 
- The Economist
- Onefootball

## Firebase use cases
The Firebase use cases include:
- MVPs (Minimum viable products)
- Chat and messaging apps
- Realtime applications
- Ads optimization based on user behavior
- User retention optimization via machine learning
- Business applications

## Benefits of using Firebase
- Free to start (Spark plan is free)
- Security
- Generates traffic to apps
- End-to-end app development platform
- Development speed
- Serverless
- Error monitoring
- Powered by Google
- It offers machine learning capabilities

## Firebase Features

* __Build__
  * _Databases (Cloud Firestore + Real Time Database)_  

    The Firebase mobile application development platform includes Cloud Firestore, often known as _Google Firestore_.

    Fundamentally, it is a cloud-based _NoSQL_ database for synchronising and storing data. Through native SDKs, Firebase users can access Firestore from their mobile or web applications.

    A database maintained in the cloud is _Firebase Realtime Database_. In addition to performing real-time data synchronisation with connected clients, it enables _JSON_-based data storage.

    Using the _iOS_, _JavaScript_, and _Android SDKs_, single instances of the Realtime Database serve as clients for the building of cross-platform applications.

  * _Cloud Functions_

    The term _"Firebase Cloud Functions"_ refers to a serverless framework that enables programmers to run backend code in response to events that are generated by _HTTPS_ and _Firebase_ features. Code written in _TypeScript_ or _JavaScript_ can be stored on Google cloud and run in a controlled environment.

  * _Authentication_
   
    A Firebase component called authentication offers simple SDKs, backends, and ready-to-use UI libraries for user application authentication. _Phone numbers_, _passwords_, and websites like _Google_, _Twitter_, _Facebook_, and others are supported for authentication.

  * _Hosting_

    Microservices, web apps, and a variety of other content kinds can all be hosted using Firebase's flexible and scalable hosting options. Users can get _SSL_ protection and single-click rollbacks, and content can be hosted in a variety of categories.

  * _Machine Learning_
  
    Using Firebase ML's machine learning features is a great fit for anyone, regardless of skill level. You don't need to be an expert in areas like neural networks or model optimization. _TensorFlow Lite_ models can be used in mobile applications by experienced developers by using the _Firebase ML Kit APIs_.

  * _Cloud Storage_
    A service for storing objects used in application development is Firebase's Cloud Storage functionality. With this feature, users have access to download and upload security at the same level as Google, and it is appropriate for storing media files and user material.

  * _Emulator_
    The Emulator Suite now offers emulators for _Google Cloud Pub/Sub_, _Authentication_, _Cloud Functions_, _Firestore_, _RTDB_, _hosting_, and more. Additionally, a built-in user interface (UI) resembling that of the Firebase Console is present.
